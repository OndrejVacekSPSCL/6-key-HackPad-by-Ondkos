This MacroPad was made for [Hackclub Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com). 

It's a 6-key macropad witch uses XIAO RB2040. It also has  2 LEDs and runs on KMK. It is upgraded version of the [tutorial one](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide).

Throu the process of making this one, I beceme interested in PCB design and all the stuff around the hackpad. I don't have much time now (because of school), but durning the summer brake I would like to try to make entire keyboard (with keys in matrix) 

## PCB
Here's my PCB! It was made in KiCad.

## CAD Model:

It has 2 separate printed pieces. The top cover has big hole so you can see the electronics (not the best decision, I know).
